# userSpy.js

A simple javascript library that tracks each field a user changes as they
fill out a form.

# Usage

Just drop the userSpy.js file on your server and include it into the form with
a tag like the following.

  <script src="userSpy.js"></script>
  
# Future

Currently, the script just logs some json data about all the actions to the
console. In the future, it will call an API that you can setup to log the
actions to a file or database.
